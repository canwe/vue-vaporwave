# Features:

### Dedicated music player that runs across the router

### A music catalog that respond to the music player via two-way binding and vice-versa

### An interactive song library

### Scalable - UI updates automatically even on massive content expansion

### Respond to viewport change - does not break on mobile or tablet view

### An automatic loop-based display system for songs that responds to library update

### Every song, album and artist has a respective link to their Bandcamp, encouraging visitors to buy their work

## Easy integration: this code base acts as a good template to quickly build a good music-playing site. Everything has been automated - integration is as simple as replacing mp3 files and changing the html content into your own.
