          About Vaporwave
        </p>

        <p>
          Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet meme 
          that emerged in the early 2010s. The music typically features a fascination 
          with 1980s and 1990s styles of mood music such as smooth jazz, elevator music, 
          R&B, and lounge music, often sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped 
          and screwed techniques and other effects. The subculture surrounding 
          vaporwave is often associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer 
          capitalism and popular culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic 
          or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and 
          advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early Internet imagery, 
          late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork 
          and music videos.

          Originating as an ironic variant of chillwave, vaporwave was loosely derived 
          from the experimental tendencies of the mid-2000s hypnagogic pop scene and 
          pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin and Vektroid 
          (Ramona Xavier). Following the blueprint established by Vektroid's Floral Shoppe 
          (December 2011), a circle of online producers were inspired to make music in the 
          style. The movement built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit, and 4chan, with a 
          flood of new acts, many operating under online pseudonyms, turning to Bandcamp for 
          distribution. The wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012 led to a wealth of 
          subgenres and offshoots such as future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour.
